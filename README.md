# The SAFETAG Practitioner's Toolkit

This will be a compilation of useful templates and ways to stay organized while conducting a security audit based on the SAFETAG methodology. Largely inspired by the ISO 27001 toolkit here: https://www.iso27001security.com/html/toolkit.html

This resource is meant to be taken and customized to your specific needs as an information security practitioner. More to come soon, as I am starting revisions on content through the month of November.
